# Overview
This project is an enhanced version of the Minesweeper game with new bomb mechanics and a life system. The life system consists of multiple lives, allowing the player to step on a bomb with a chance of surviving.  This project introduces two new types of bombs: the Heart Drain Bomb and the Countdown Bomb.

# Game Concept
Players start with three hearts and there will be 15 bombs on the board. If a player steps on a bomb, it will cause different unique effects:
- Classic Bomb: The game is over instantly.
- Heart Drain Bomb: Reduces one heart. If the player has no remaining hearts after stepping on this bomb, the game is over.
- Countdown Bomb: Starts a countdown timer (30 seconds). However, if the game is not won before the countdown ends, the game is over.

To win the game, the player must reveal all non-bomb tiles by clicking on them before running out of hearts or time.
